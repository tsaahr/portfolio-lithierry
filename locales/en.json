Since then, I’ve been specializing in back-end development, studying Rails, data modeling, and API creation.\n\nEven early in my career, I’ve built complete personal projects with authentication, integrations, and deployment. I always strive to write clean code, communicate well, and learn fast. I value simplicity, clarity, and delivering real value.\n\nMy current focus is to grow as a Ruby developer, contribute to meaningful projects, and pursue opportunities in collaborative environments — including remote international teams.\n\nIf you’re looking for someone committed, growth-minded, and ready to make an impact, I’d love to connect."
